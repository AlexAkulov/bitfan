## Details

### Add_field
* Value type is hash
* Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.

### Tags
* Value type is array
* Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event. Tags can be dynamic
and include parts of the event using the %{field} syntax.

### Type
* Value type is string
* Default value is `""`

Add a type field to all events handled by this input

### Codec
* Value type is string
* Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding
your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your bitfan pipeline

### read_older
* Value type is int
* Default value is `0`

How many seconds a file should stay unmodified to be read
use this to prevent reading a file while another process is writing into.

### discover_interval
* Value type is int
* Default value is `0`

How often (in seconds) we expand the filename patterns in the path option
to discover new files to watch. Default value is 15

### exclude
* Value type is array
* Default value is `[]`

Exclusions (matched against the filename, not full path).
Filename patterns are valid here, too.

### ignore_older
* Value type is int
* Default value is `0`

When the file input discovers a file that was last modified before the
specified timespan in seconds, the file is ignored.
After itâ€™s discovery, if an ignored file is modified it is no longer ignored
and any new data is read.
Default value is 86400 (i.e. 24 hours)

### max_open_files
* Value type is int
* Default value is `0`

What is the maximum number of file_handles that this input consumes at any one time.
Use close_older to close some files if you need to process more files than this number.

### path
* This is a required setting.
* Value type is array
* Default value is `[]`

The path(s) to the file(s) to use as an input.
You can use filename patterns here, such as /var/log/*.log.
If you use a pattern like /var/log/**/*.log, a recursive search of /var/log
will be done for all *.log files.
Paths must be absolute and cannot be relative.
You may also configure multiple paths.

### sincedb_path
* Value type is string
* Default value is `""`

Path of the sincedb database file
The sincedb database keeps track of the current position of monitored
log files that will be written to disk.
